- The notebook named `US Used Car Price Prediciton.ipynb` contains the full version of our code. Running the cells in order will do all the operations we did that were presented in our final presentation and report.

- To just to reproduce our experiment results, please use the Demo.ipynb notebook. The result may be a little different because the LGB and XGB models were trained on GPU, but the difference of the final RMSE between the running result and our report should be less than 1.

- Condisering the size of data and model, we suggest to use high-RAM with GPU runtime in Google Colab.
