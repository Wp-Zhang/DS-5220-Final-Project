The notebook named 'US Used Car Price Prediciton.ipynb' contains the full version of our code. Running the cells in order will do all the operations we did that were presented in our final presentation and report.

Condisering the size of data and model, we suggest to use high-RAM with GPU runtime in Google Colab.

To just to reproduce our experiment results, please use the Demo.ipynb notebook.
